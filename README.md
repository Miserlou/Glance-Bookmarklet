# OpenSpritz

OpenSpritz is an extremely crude implementation of [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/) in JavaScript.

I made this for fun in a few minutes just because of how much I liked the Spritz demo.

## TODO

* Make it a little jQuery library.
  * With some documentaiton.
* Make a bookmarklet which will Spritzify highlighted text.

_Neither of these things will likely ever materialize. Please, be my guest._

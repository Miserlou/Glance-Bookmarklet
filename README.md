# OpenSpritz

OpenSpritz is an extremely crude implementation of [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/) in JavaScript. It works as a bookmarklet to add Spritz-type speed reading to every page.

### Testimonials

blazingly fast." - [norswap](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7349966), HackerNews

## Contributing

OpenSpritz needs you! If you find bugs, have feature requests, or have other needs, please help out!

The best way to contribute is to start a new ticket, or to work on an existing ticket. If you find a website which doesn't work with OpenSpritz, [add it to this ticket](https://github.com/Miserlou/OpenSpritz/issues/8) so that it can be diagnosed and fixed.

OpenSpritz currently needs a little more love to make it work with JSONP and needs a better method of detecting the presence of jQuery, so those are some good places to start.

Once you have tested your changes and confirmed they work, send a pull request. Add yourself to the list of contributors below as well!

### Important note!

Please be sure to submit your pull requests to the _dev_ branch, rather than _master_. Since the currently deployed
version depends on accessing the raw resources from Github master, all changes must be reviewed for functionality and
security testing before they can be merged directly. Thank you!

#### A Note About the Name

OpenSpritz has nothing to do with [Spritz Incorporated](http://www.spritzinc.com/). This is an open source, community created project, made with love because Spritz is such an awesome technique for reading with. _(Please don't send us a DMCA take down request! That'll only backfire on you anyway. We love you.)_

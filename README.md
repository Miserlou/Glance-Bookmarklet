## Contributing

OpenSpritz needs you! If you find bugs, have feature requests, or have other needs, please help out!

The best way to contribute is to start a new ticket, or to work on an existing ticket. If you find a website which doesn't work with OpenSpritz, [add it to this ticket](https://github.com/Miserlou/OpenSpritz/issues/8) so that it can be diagnosed and fixed.

OpenSpritz currently needs a little more love to make it work with JSONP and needs a better method of detecting the presence of jQuery, so those are some good places to start.

Once you have tested your changes and confirmed they work, send a pull request. Add yourself to the list of contributors below as well!

#### A Note About the Name

OpenSpritz has nothing to do with [Spritz Incorporated](http://www.spritzinc.com/). This is an open source, community created project, made with love because Spritz is such an awesome technique for reading with. _(Please don't send us a DMCA take down request! That'll only backfire on you anyway. We love you.)_
